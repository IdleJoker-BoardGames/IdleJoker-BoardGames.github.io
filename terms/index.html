Click on this link to read our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></p>
<p><strong>You must follow our Rules whenever you use our Services</strong></p>
<p>As a condition of using our Services you agree to comply at all times with the following rules (our “Rules”).</p>
<p>You agree that you will not do any act, or share, distribute, make available, or transmit any data, message, or file that:<br>• is sexually explicit, vulgar or obscene;<br>• amounts to a form of cheating;<br>• amounts to a personal attack on others;<br>• bullies or harasses others;<br>• amounts to, or encourages, any illegal activity;<br>• impersonates anyone, or misrepresents your identity;<br>• deletes or changes any legal notices, disclaimers, proprietary notices, copyright or trademarks;<br>• infringes anyone else’s rights.

<p>In addition, it is against the Rules to participate in any of the following:<br>• any attacks, including without for example, denial of service attacks or other similar attempts to interfere with other’s use of the Services;<br>• attempting to gain unauthorised access to the Services, computers, or networks connected to the Services;<br>• use of cheats, bots, automation software, hacks, or any third-party software designed to interfere with the Services;<br>• modification of any software that forms part of the Services;<br>• disrupting or overburdening computers or servers;<br>• attempting to circumvent or modify any security features;<br>• harassment or abuse of others; or<br>• obtaining or using personal information about others or sharing anyone’s personal information through the Services.</p>
<p>We may terminate or restrict your right to use the Services, or disable your account, if we think that you have not followed the Rules or if we reasonably believe that you have otherwise behaved inappropriately while using our Services. In addition, if we believe you have cheated in any way, then we may also remove any applicable in-game purchases from you including for example, any Virtual Items, which you have obtained by cheating.</p>
<p>If you think that another user may be breaching our Rules, please let us know, using the contact details below. However, we cannot guarantee that others will comply with the Rules, and we are not responsible for any other user’s failure to comply with them.</p>
<p>We may delete any material that we consider breaches our Rules. You agree that we may share information which identifies you with law enforcement officials if we think we need to, including in relation to any possible breaches of our Rules. Please read our Privacy Policy which explains in more detail how we may use your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>We may update the Services from time to time</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may deploy or provide patches, updates, upgrades, additional content or other modifications to the Services (for example for maintenance, enhancements, to add or remove features, resolve software bugs or address security concerns).</p>
<p>These updates and upgrades may result in the Services being temporarily unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may need to suspend, withdraw or disable the Services for longer periods while we deploy these updates and upgrades. We will always try and give you notice of this, but it may not be possible all cases. We would always recommend that you have the latest version of the Services installed. If you do not install any update or upgrade then all of the functionality and features of the Services may not be available to you.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Items</strong></p>
<p>Our Services may enable you to acquire certain virtual items. This includes, for example, virtual currency, points, or similar virtual items (together “Virtual Items”). You agree that you do not actually own these Virtual Items and the virtual value of any Virtual Item does not correspond or equate to any real-life monetary value, credit balance or currency.</p>
<p>Any virtual currency or similar balance does not constitute a real-world balance or comprise any stored value. Your right to use the Virtual Items is personal to you unless we agree otherwise, and is limited to the licence granted below - see section below entitled “Your right to use the Services”. You may not re-sell or trade any Virtual Items.</p>
<p>Please note that if you remove and reinstall a game on a new device, you may lose your in-game purchases, including any Virtual Items.</p>
<p><strong>Who owns the content made available through the Services?</strong></p>
<p>We either own, or have a licence to use, all of the content and information contained in the Services (including our games), including all the intellectual property rights in our Services. For example, we own, or have a licence to use, all the software code, graphics, images, trademarks, designs, logos, videos and text in our games.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to use the Services unless expressly allowed under these Terms. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or modify the Services in any way.</p>
<p><strong>User Content</strong></p>
<p>The Services may allow you to create a username and an online identity which allows you to communicate with others. For example, our Services may allow you to share custom boards (“User Content”).</p>
<p>You promise that you have the right to share and use such User Content, that it and you will comply with the Rules when doing so. You agree that we may use your User Content for any purpose in connection with the Services (including re-posting it and sharing it) without any payment or obligation to you or anyone else. We may remove any potentially infringing User Content without notice.</p>
<p><strong>Your right to use the Services</strong></p>
<p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, personal, non-transferable, revocable, limited licence to access and use the Services for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Services for any other purpose.</p>

This includes, for example, any loss or damages which is indirect or which is a side effect of the main loss or damage, such as loss of revenue or salary, or loss of profit, opportunity or reputation.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud. We do not make any statement, guarantee or promise in respect of the Services not set out in these Terms, including, without limitation, any statements made by third parties, such as third party advertisers.</p>
<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that our Services are free from viruses and other malicious software but we also recommend you use appropriate anti-virus software.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I download a game through an online store such as the iTunes App Store or Google Play Store?</strong></p>
<p>You will also be asked to agree to the relevant online store terms which will also apply in addition to these Terms. You should read these online store terms carefully.</p>
<p>If you make any in-game purchases, then the relevant online store provider’s terms and conditions will also apply.

<p><strong>Questions, complaints and disputes</strong></p>
<p>We will do our best to resolve any disputes over these Terms of Use and your use of the Services.</p>

However, if you are a consumer and resident of any European Union country you will benefit from mandatory provisions of, and legal rights available to you under, the laws of that country. Nothing in these Terms affects your rights as a consumer to rely on these local law mandatory provisions and legal rights.</p>
<p>You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are a consumer and resident of any European Union country you and we may also bring proceedings in that country.</p>

<p>The terms and conditions of the relevant online store include also instructions explaining what to do if a game is defective. Your rights and remedies for defective games and how to exercise them are set out in the relevant terms and conditions of the relevant online store.</p>
<p><strong>Our right to end the contract or restrict access to our Services</strong></p>
<p>We may end our contract with you to use the Services if you breach any of these Terms, or if you breach the terms you have entered into with any third party involved in a transaction. For example, if you breach the Google Play, or Apple Appstore terms and conditions.</p>
<p>If you breach any of these Terms, we may also choose, at our discretion, to restrict your access to any part of the Services. For example, we may close any account you have with us. We will try to give you notice of this and a chance to appeal where possible though.</p>
<p><strong>If you breach these Terms, or if your account is closed, you may lose access to in-game purchases you have made and other data</strong></p>
<p>If we end our contract with you to use the Services, or restrict your access to any part of the Services, we may in our discretion delete certain data relating to your use of the game, or disable access to it. This may include, for example, saved games, high scores, or your position in a league table.

<p><strong>Do I have to be a certain age to use the Services?</strong></p>
<p>The Services are not intended for use by children. For some Services you may need to register and should be at least over 16 to do so. If you help someone who is 16 or under to register for or otherwise use any Services you assume full liability for any consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Other important legal terms</strong></p>

If that part cannot be amended, it will be deleted. The amendment or deletion of any part of these Terms shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the Terms.</p>
<p>If we do not enforce any right we have against you, this does not prevent us from enforcing this right at a later date. A person who is not a party to these Terms does not have any rights under them.</p>
